## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into various financial markets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, and currencies. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using Python, and the dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends to assist users in making informed investment decisions.

## Features
